RabbitMQSimpleHashCracker

Created this script while doing pentest without a GPU; anyway I had to try just a small list, not much.

But, wanted to share it on github and it is here!

For now, it is only cracking rabbit_password_hashing_sha256 type hashes but, if you change few places it is gonna work well :)
